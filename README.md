# RateMyProfessor.com-review
The goal of this project is to use the text in a RateMyProfessor.com review to predict the difficulty and quality score the reviewer assigned to the professor. To do this, I used the datasets provided by Dr. Hibo Je's - specifically the sample data - and dataset provided on Kaggle. I used NLTK to preprocess the dataset, and then used GLoVe's pre-trained word embedding.
